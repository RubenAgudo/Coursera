COURSERA
================
My solutions for the homework given in coursera.

Everything is released under the GPLv3 license.
Every course has its own folder to keep it clear.

Even if you found this and your course is ongoing, keep in mind that you have to follow the Coursera Honor Code, and if you copy, inspire or anything, you should feel very bad
