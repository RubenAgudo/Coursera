README
======

This is my ModernArtUI App.

The App was created using the Eclipse Luna IDE using the Android Development Tools.

Compatibility
-----------------
The app has been tested in an 4" screen phone with a resolution of 480*800 with Android 4.0.4 (API 15). Nevertheless, if 
you have an older device, 2.2 or greater, you can change the build target, But I recommend you to use the emulator with
the given specs of this readme.

Oh, and please, test it in portrait, I haven't created a landscape layout.

Screencast
------------

I have created a video where I show how the app works. You can view it here:
